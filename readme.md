# MEDOCS  
  
You often have have to register your drug list.  This list may be big and long.  Sometimes it's difficult
You can write it i a paper or save it on excel or word file maybe.  
Not the best way ... are you organize with you files, your papers ?  
  
  
If you are sick or physically diminished you would have to share this list with your doctor, nurse or paramedic ...  perhaps someone in your family.  
  
In this case you need a system.  

[medocs.be](https://medocs.be)  do that the simple way.
  
Medocs.be is an easy webside, you can register in less than one minute and quicly :  
- add a drug with some details (frequency, quantity, the moment)  
- modify or delete a line  
- share it.
